Circa 2007, I stumbled upon the great wasteland known as [MySpace.com](https://myspace.com/). I wrote my first lines of
CSS trying to make the background of my profile a baller shade of <span style="color:#FC3F93">Fuchsia</span>. As an
adult, card-carrying Software Engineer {exp.casualYearsExperience} years later, I’m still trying to get that same high.

I have worked for the last {exp.professionalYearsExperience} years at a few web-SaaS [software][shoobx]
[startups][notarize] writing code that only just barely makes the thing work. In my defense, isn't that really what
engineering is -- making the cheapest solution that still works? You can read my [full résumé][resume] online.

These days I have been thinking more about educational content for the working practitioner and what it means to be an
engineer today. Hopefully this blog gives me a chance to occasionally dust off my Philosophy degree and share some
hard-earned lessons from my experience in the industry.

### Projects
