The technology industry is obsessed with capturing and bottling magic. The VC-fueled segment with which I'm most
familiar, in particular, aims to captivate consumers with technology that is constantly visible and engaging. Marketing
sites and product decks are rife with phrases such as "grand central" and "the platform hub" for this or that. Tech is
touted as the magic charm that everyone will drive to move the next-gen economy. Even businesses that don't need venture
capital are selling this kind of magic: for example, Apple will soon ship an AR/VR appliance that literally takes over
our vision and is supposed to re-enchant everything before our eyes. In order to meet today's financial and social
pressures, modern tech business has cultivated a "type."

Is there room for a different take on magic: one featuring the disappearing act? An overlooked aspect of technology is
its ability to become invisible infrastructure and reward us in ways that flashy solutions do not. This kind of magic
would **not** be about doing more: it's a vision of doing the same with less. Things that don't require constant
attention are magical because they free us to focus on more demanding and important issues in our lives. I don't think
about memory management in the Linux kernel, interact with SSL handshakes, or engage with the software that handles my
paycheck. If I step back for a moment and think about what these solutions are doing for me, I am amazed and grateful
because I get to spend more time with problems technology _can't_ help me with. Even if it's utilizing ["boring"
technology that doesn't make the news][boring_tech], if the magic is done well, nobody will even notice at all; products
don't have to be everything to everyone to be exciting.

Solutions that are fueled by or sell "user engagement" are threats to our focus and attention. We only have so much
mental headspace and time, so we should take great care with them. To that end, I'd like to see software actively
disappear. I don't want more subscription-based SaaS tools that I need to interact with every day or more apps that prey
on my attention for clicks and ad revenue. I see this as a goal for not only end users of technology but also its
creators and maintainers. What's more magical than a piece of code that never needs to be updated or migrated? I want to
see more buzz for ideas such as [self-healing code that runs forever][forever_code] and funding for projects that are
simple enough to actually complete without endless "improving."

Our ambitions and energies could be utilized for truly magical ends if we re-imagine what technology is capable of.
