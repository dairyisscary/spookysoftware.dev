As I gain more experience in the tech industry, I've been thinking more about what it means to be a leader. How does one
lead well across the spectrum of roles -- as staff engineer, tech lead, CEO, manager, or others? How does one do a good
job, and what does success look like? Here are some "resume pieces" that I often encounter as characteristics of a good
leader in technology:

- Intimate industry knowledge and domain expertise
- High degrees of technical proficiency
- Passion and drive
- Strong networking skills and industry connections
- Creative and unconventional thinking

These attributes are useful tools to have for any successful venture, but I think they also miss the point. I could
possess all of these, yet they wouldn't reveal whether or not I'm capable of leading work that _matters_. If we focus
too much on the project's technical soundness, operational efficiency, or even profitability, then we can become
confused about what we're doing and whom we are doing it for. Instead, we need leaders who possess qualities that
inspire mission-driven work that is grounded ethically. A clearly defined ethical mission elevates work beyond simple
`TODO`s and business milestones and ultimately, makes the project meaningful.

### Parameters of Meaningful Work

Organizations can have a wide range of missions, and I don't mean to prescribe what they should look like. We all should
get the opportunity to choose what's important to us. However, I think there are some _boundaries_ that all mission
statements should operate in. It is leadership's primary responsibility to corral and shepherd the organization in the
following ways.

First, ethically grounded work begins with transparency and excellent communication from leadership about the mission
itself. Good leadership focuses deeply on answering the questions below for everyone on the project and assures that
collaborators are on the same page, especially other leaders:

- What are the objectives of the organization?
- Why are those objectives valuable? And whom do they benefit?
- What methodologies are we choosing? Why did we choose them?

For the sake of safeguarding the mission, leaders embed open, transparent, and free-flowing discussion deep into the
organization's everyday practice. They call for regular, frequent feedback that is frictionlessly given and taken, with
high degrees of psychological safety. They also offer training on how to dispense and receive feedback, so that
collaborators can work independently with confidence and offer corrections when things get off-track. Good leaders
recognize that open questioning ought to be tools for clarification and understanding of the mission and how work aligns
with it.

Moreover, meaningful work requires leaders to treat colleagues with respect and consideration. I worry that we focus too
much, for instance, on a director's ability to promote growth in product delivery and not enough on their ability to
promote growth in the people who build that product. Extraordinary leaders craft workplaces and cultures that motivate
not just quality output, but also, more importantly, enable those involved to better themselves. Leaders advocate for,
share with, and invest in those around them; they inspire and **require** professional growth. Successful leadership is
where participants are more equipped than they were the day before and where they can have uninhibited access to the
good life. Growth isn't just for the business, external stakeholders, and customers, but also coworkers.

Finally, good leaders ensure inclusivity because it is paramount to successful and impactful work for everyone. Diverse
perspectives and backgrounds help us to be smarter and more innovative. If someone is forgotten in the process, an
organization is no longer entitled to the execution of its mission and is not meeting its full potential to enable its
collaborators' growth. To that end, leaders ensure their efforts to encourage diversity are not superficial. Tokenism
cannot lead to meaningful work. Contributions can come in many shapes, sizes, and frequencies, and they may be fueled by
differing reagents because, ultimately, meaningful work is about the beat that these contributions step to and the
vision they service.

### Markers of Success

What are the markers and measurements of good leadership? What are not? With a well established culture of open and
regular feedback from all corners of the organization, leadership can critically reflect on their own performance and
measure others' trust in them. In particular, feedback should be used as a signal of whether collaborators feel that
leadership is clearly communicating the mission and maintaining the relevant constraints on work.

In addition, leaders should find ways to measure, as directly as possible, how closely the organization's actions align
with its mission. For example, if the mission is to decrease the negative environmental effects of data center
computing, leaders should prioritize measuring, say, the impact of the product on data center electrical usage, over
tangential metrics such as "user engagement." If leadership has spent enough effort assuring that everyone believes in
the mission in the first place, then these direct metrics can also be a reflection of the meaningfulness of the work for
employees.

Perhaps, to some extent, [all metrics are false shepherds][goodharts_law]. Here are some commonly employed, but
misleading, measurements of successful leadership:

A leader should be careful when prioritizing "consistency" for its own sake. I often witness leaders give too much
weight to some sense of stability within an organization. Just because the team was building one kind of product
yesterday doesn't mean that they need to continue to build the same one today. One becomes blind to new insights if they
mistakenly see persistence as more valuable than realizing the mission itself. A leader's commitment is to cohesion in
messaging of vision and clarity in communication -- not to particular implementations of that mission statement.
Changing directions is not a marker of failure, but can be an indicator of growth in leadership and the organization.

Additionally, being an exceptional leader is not the same thing as being omnipotent. Leaders should avoid measuring
their skills against the skills of their coworkers. They don't need to be the best at every skill the organization needs
or know exactly the best way to implement everything. An engineering manager doesn't need to know how to [turn the
database inside out][database_inside_out], the exact [details of making an inclusive and accessible web
interface][inclusive_interface], or what the best sales strategy is. Good leaders enact guardrails, philosophy, and
high-level constraints; they don't draw maps or dictate exactly how it all happens in practice. If leaders foster
institutions where experimentation is freely granted and respected, then they can be force multipliers for those they
lead. It's the employee's job to be amazing at what they do, grow, and execute on the shared mission in the best way
they know how.

### Building Teams

It's important for leaders to recognize how crucial hiring and retention practices are to executing on a mission.
Conventional thinking about how to manage personnel can handicap leadership's responsibility to enforce accountability
to the mission. For example, especially for new and small organizations, it can be tempting to hire anyone who's willing
to work on the project at all. However, just because someone is an old college buddy doesn't mean they care about the
vision; you need _allies_ for the mission, not friends. As another example, high employee retention rate is commonly
seen as a marker of strong leadership, but retention for retention's sake disables one's ability to let someone go who
isn't on the same page. I would advise that one be more picky and ensure that hires are truly for the right reasons,
instead of falling for romantic ideals of "making it work as we go" or "sticking it out." Missteps here are an outright
disservice and a drain on both parties' time and energy. I would say if no one is ever leaving or even, occasionally,
being dismissed, the organization is not actually encouraging growth in its members.

When recruiting, leaders should evaluate candidates for _alignment_ with the mission, not just expertise, technical
know-how, and experience. This may mean skipping the coding exercises, especially for more senior candidates, and
instead, looking to other modes of assessment, like essay writing or interviews about the candidate's values,
perspective, and philosophy. Candidates should be required to answer mission alignment questions such as "What attracted
you to this position?" Leaders can also ensure that the candidate has enough time (not the "last 10 minutes") to ask
[questions that demonstrate motivations, aspirations, and values][candidate_questions]. I could go on and on about how
[wasteful and exclusionary whiteboarding interviews are][fuck_whiteboards], but it's also massively draining on the
organization later when there's a sudden surprise that a new employee feels very differently about goals and vision.
Leaders should reject candidates for misalignment as easily as they reject someone for lack of technical competence. An
engineer with 20 years of experience may be an attractive hire but still not belong on the team if they don't agree with
the mission.

I recognize that "cultural fit" has been used in unacceptably discriminatory ways -- actively excluding women, people of
color, and others from the technology industry. But I believe that with ongoing, critical reflection and willingness to
engage in anti-racist, anti-sexist practice, we can still be discriminating in ethical, equitable ways and avoid
exclusionary or cultish environments. Hiring processes should include specific and aggressive diversity goals, but
relevant values and mission alignment are not dimensions of diversity one should be aiming for.

### Being More

I acknowledge that the perspective presented here on meaningful work and effective leadership comes from a position of
privilege, especially in the technology industry, which enjoys a particularly cushy existence. The opportunity to see
labor beyond a monetary transaction is not equally available to everyone. However, this is precisely why I am appealing
to leaders in technology and calling for action: leaders in this space can afford to break the _status quo_ and provide
this privilege to their colleagues.

Technological "innovation," industry "disruption," and "crushing it" are themselves never the goals; the organization
has a deeper mission that leadership defines and focuses their collaborators' efforts on. It is the primary objective of
a good leader to heighten work to be more than software specs, more than quarterly financials, more than product
milestones, and even, more than employee paychecks. C-Suite executives, tech leads, hiring managers, staff and principal
engineers, and other leaders should drive efforts toward a mission in order to elevate work to be more meaningful.
