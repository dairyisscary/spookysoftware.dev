        <p>
          Circa 2007, I stumbled upon the great wasteland known as{" "}
          <NewTabLink href="https://myspace.com/">MySpace.com</NewTabLink>. I
          wrote my first lines of CSS trying to make the background of my
          profile a baller shade of{" "}
          <span title={FUCHSIA} style={{ color: FUCHSIA }}>
            Fuchsia
          </span>
          . As an adult, card-carrying Software Engineer {yearsSince2007} years
          later, I'm still trying to get that same high.

          I have worked for the last {yearsSince2014} years at a few web-SaaS{" "}
          <NewTabLink href="https://www.shoobx.com/">software</NewTabLink>{" "}
          <NewTabLink href="https://www.notarize.com/">startups</NewTabLink>{" "}
          writing code that only just barely makes the thing work. In my
          defense, isnâ€™t that really what engineering is -- making the cheapest
          solution that still works?

          These days I have been thinking more about educational content for the
          working practitioner and what it means to be an engineer today.
          Hopefully this blog gives me a chance to occasionally dust off my
          Philosophy degree and share some hard-earned lessons from my
          experience in the industry.
